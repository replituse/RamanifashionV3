Admin Dashboard Fixes & UI Improvements
(A) Admin Dashboard / Panel Fixes

1. Remove Floating Up Arrow Button:

In the admin panel (see uploaded 1st image), remove the up arrow floating button permanently.

Ensure the layout and alignment remain consistent after removal.

2. Prevent Redirect to User Login on Internal Admin Navigation:

Currently, when clicking on sidebar items like Products, Inventory, Analytics, or Settings, the system redirects to the user login page — fix this issue.

Admin should stay inside the admin dashboard environment (e.g., /admin/dashboard, /admin/inventory, /admin/settings) without being redirected.

Ensure all admin pages open within the same admin layout and retain sidebar + header.

If session expires, only then redirect to /admin (admin login).

Confirm all admin routes are protected by admin authentication middleware (e.g., verifyAdminAuth).

3. Logout Redirection:

When the Logout button is clicked inside the admin dashboard,
→ clear admin session/token,
→ then redirect to homepage (e.g., /),
→ not to user login or admin login page.

(B) User Profile Popup & Admin Button Removal

1. Remove “Login as Admin” Option:

In the user profile dropdown (see 2nd uploaded image), remove the “Login as Admin” option completely.

This should not appear for any user.

2. Improve User Profile Popup Design:

When the user clicks on the profile icon, open a modern popup/modal (instead of dropdown) with smooth animation.

Keep design clean and minimal — matching the theme of your project.

Adjust typography:

Decrease text size slightly for My Profile, My Orders, and My Wishlist.

Maintain proper spacing and consistent icons.

Developer Notes / Implementation Guidelines:

Verify separate authentication sessions for user and admin to prevent cross-redirects.

Maintain routing consistency:

/admin/dashboard → Admin main panel

/admin/inventory → Inventory management

/admin/settings → Settings page

Use route protection middleware to check for admin token before accessing admin pages.

Use modal or React Portal for the user popup (if React-based frontend).

Maintain consistent responsive behavior across desktop and mobile.

✅ Expected Result After Implementation:

Admin dashboard fully isolated and functional (no unwanted redirects).

Admin logout returns to homepage only.

Clean user profile popup with no “Login as Admin” button.

Admin navigation works smoothly within the panel.
