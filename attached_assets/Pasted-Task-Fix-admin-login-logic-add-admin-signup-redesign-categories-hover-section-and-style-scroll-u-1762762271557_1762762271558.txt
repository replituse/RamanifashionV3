Task: Fix admin login logic, add admin signup, redesign categories hover section, and style scroll-up arrow in the existing eCommerce project.

1️⃣ Admin Login Redirection & Access Fix

Issue:
When manually entering /admin in the URL, it opens the admin login page but after mobile verification, it redirects to the user login page instead of the admin dashboard.

Required Fix:

When /admin is opened, it should properly display the Admin Login Page.

After entering the correct credentials:

Email: admin@ramanifashion.com

Password: Admin@123

OTP: 123456
→ Redirect the admin to the Admin Dashboard page.

Ensure that the admin panel loads fully with all admin options visible (orders, users, products, categories, etc.).

Prevent normal users from accessing /admin (if a normal user tries, show “Access Denied” or redirect to home).

Make sure mobile OTP verification works seamlessly with the above credentials and does not redirect to user login.

2️⃣ Add “Admin Signup” Option in Login Modal

Requirement:
When clicking on the user icon → Login, add an extra button or link labeled “Sign Up as Admin” below the “Login as Admin” option.

Functionality:

When clicked, it should open a small Admin Signup form (fields: name, email, mobile, password).

After signup, the admin should receive OTP verification (use same test OTP: 123456).

On successful signup, redirect to the Admin Dashboard.

3️⃣ Category Hover Section Redesign (Use Uploaded 1st Image Style)

Current Issue: Categories are shown as vertical cards with text — looks plain.
Required Fix:

Redesign the Categories section horizontally (in a single row) — 7 categories in one line.

Use the uploaded image reference style: circular category frames, attractive background, and subtle border.

Add smooth hover effects:

Slight zoom-in or fade animation on hover.

Category name appears elegantly below the image.

Add a background image for the section (soft texture, same color tone as website).

Make sure layout is fully responsive across desktop and mobile.

4️⃣ Scroll-to-Top Arrow Button

Requirement:

Add a “Back to Top” arrow button in the bottom-left corner of the site.

The button should:

Match the website’s pink color theme.

Be round, elevated with shadow, and visible only when scrolled down.

Smoothly scroll to top when clicked.

Have a hover animation (slight scale-up or color lighten effect).

🧭 Additional Notes

Keep all design elements consistent with the existing Ramani Fashion branding and color palette.

Maintain smooth animations and responsiveness.

Test both user and admin login/signup flows thoroughly.

Verify that /admin URL access works perfectly and only for authorized admin users.

✅ Expected Outcome:

/admin opens and works perfectly for admin login and OTP verification.

Successful login redirects to the admin dashboard (not user login).

“Sign Up as Admin” option added under login modal.

Category hover section redesigned horizontally with smooth animations.

Scroll-to-top arrow styled in pink theme and functions properly.
