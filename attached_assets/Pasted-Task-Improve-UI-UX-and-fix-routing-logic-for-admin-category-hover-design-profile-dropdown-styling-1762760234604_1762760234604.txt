Task: Improve UI/UX and fix routing logic for admin, category hover design, profile dropdown styling, and search filter in existing eCommerce project.

1️⃣ Admin Login Redirection Fix

When someone manually enters /admin in the URL:

It should properly open the Admin Login Page.

After entering mobile number and completing mobile verification, redirect the user directly to the Admin Dashboard (not to the user login page).

Ensure that only verified admin users can access the admin panel.

If a normal user tries to access /admin, show an “Access Denied” or “Unauthorized” message and redirect to home.

2️⃣ Categories Section UI Redesign (Homepage)

Refer to the uploaded first and second images:

Replace the existing card-based category layout (first image) with a horizontal section like in the second image.

Show 7 categories in a single line with circular frames or decorative borders and one background image behind all.

On hover, show a smooth zoom or glow effect and category name below each image.

Must be responsive and maintain same alignment across all devices.

3️⃣ Profile Dropdown Styling (See 3rd Image)

Increase font size of “My Profile”, “My Orders”, “My Wishlist”, and “Logout”.

Use clean, modern, slightly bold typography with a subtle hover animation (e.g., text color change or underline).

Add a small drop shadow or soft background to make the dropdown more visible and elegant.

Ensure hover effects and font styling are consistent with website theme colors.

4️⃣ Scroll to Top (Arrow) Button

Add a “Go to Top” arrow button in the bottom-left corner.

Button should:

Follow the website’s color theme (example: gold, maroon, or beige tones).

Be rounded with a smooth hover animation.

Only appear when the user scrolls down.

Scroll smoothly to top when clicked.

5️⃣ Search Filter Enhancement (Category Search)

Make the search filter fully functional for saree categories.

When user types in the search box:

Show real-time category matches (autocomplete or filter results).

If no match is found, show a popup/toast message saying:

“No matching category found. Please try again.”

Ensure it works for partial matches (e.g., typing “Jam” should match “Jamdani Paithani”).

🧭 Notes:

Follow clean, responsive, and professional UI design standards.

Maintain same color theme, typography, and animations as the rest of the site.

Ensure all functions work across desktop and mobile.

Test all redirections and hover effects before final deployment.

✅ Expected Output:
A fully functional and visually refined saree eCommerce site with:

Correct admin redirection and access control

Elegant horizontal category hover layout

Enhanced profile dropdown

Smooth “Scroll to Top” feature

Working search filter with feedback
