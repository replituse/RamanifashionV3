🧩 Project Goals

Make the website interface smoother, more professional, and add a secure admin login page with OTP verification (MongoDB-based).

🧱 Tasks to Implement
1️⃣ Profile Dropdown Redesign

Refer to the first uploaded image.

Create a modern, elegant dropdown for the user profile section (when clicking the profile icon or username).

It should include:

Profile name (capitalize properly, e.g., “Pratik K”)

Menu items: My Profile, My Orders, My Wishlist, Logout

Add hover effects and smooth open/close transitions (fade or slide).

Design style:

Rounded corners

Soft box-shadow

Smooth animation (CSS transition or GSAP optional)

Use minimalistic icons beside each menu item (e.g., fa-user, fa-box, fa-heart, fa-sign-out).

2️⃣ Category Hover & Click Animation (Header Section)

Refer to the second uploaded image.

When hovering over header menu items (like “DRESSES”, “ACCS”, etc.), display a dropdown category section like shown in the image.

The dropdown should:

Appear with a smooth transition (slide-down or fade-in effect)

Contain category thumbnails with names (e.g., “Long Dress”, “Midi Dress”, “Maxi Dress”, “Ethnic Dress”)

Be fully responsive (work on all devices)

On clicking a category image or title, navigate to that category’s product listing page.

3️⃣ Admin Login Page via URL

Add a route such as /Admin in the URL.
When visited manually (e.g., https://yourwebsite.com/Admin), open a dedicated admin login page.

🖥️ Admin Login Page Requirements:

Fields:

Email (text)

Password (password input)

OTP (displayed only after email/password verification)

MongoDB Integration:

Use existing MongoDB connection.

Store the following admin credentials in admin_users collection:

{
  "email": "pratikkadam@gmail.com",
  "password": "pk@123",
  "mobile": "7304707775"
}


Login Flow:

User enters email and password.

Check credentials in MongoDB.

If valid → show a masked mobile number (e.g., +91 89*******56).

Ask to enter OTP (temporary OTP for testing: 123456).

After OTP verification → redirect to the Admin Dashboard (/admin/dashboard).

Error Handling:

Show proper error messages: “Invalid credentials”, “Incorrect OTP”, etc.

UI Design:

Simple, elegant admin login box centered on the page.

Use subtle shadows and modern typography.

Add a small “Admin Login” heading with a minimal logo or lock icon.
