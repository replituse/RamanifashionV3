Goal:
Improve admin login/signup flow and redesign key front-end UI sections for smoother experience and professional look.

1️⃣ Admin Login & Signup System (with OTP Verification)

Requirements:

Add a new button on the main login popup or user icon dropdown — label it “Login as Admin”.

When clicked:

Open a separate Admin Login Form (similar style as user login).

Fields: Email, Password, and Verify with Mobile Number.

When admin exists in database → allow login after temporary OTP verification (e.g. 123456).

If admin does not exist, show an option/button “Sign Up as Admin” to register a new admin account.

After successful login or signup, redirect to the Admin Dashboard — not user login or homepage.

Credentials to test:

Email: admin@ramanifashion.com

Password: Admin@123

OTP: 123456

Additional Requirements:

Store admin users in a separate DB collection/table (not mixed with normal users).

Ensure OTP works via temp verification logic.

Protect admin routes so only verified admins can access /admin and dashboard pages.

2️⃣ Categories Hover Section Redesign (Use 2nd Uploaded Image as Reference)

Requirements:

Remove the old card-based category UI.

Redesign it like shown in the 2nd uploaded image:

All categories visible in one horizontal line (single row).

Each category image inside a decorative circle frame.

On hover:

Show a smooth zoom or fade-in effect.

Display category name below the image.

Keep the design clean, simple, and elegant using brand color tones (beige/pink theme).

Ensure full responsiveness for both desktop and mobile views.

3️⃣ Hover Effect on Ramani Logo

Requirements:

Add a simple hover animation to the “Ramani Fashion” logo (top navbar).

Effect example:

Slight scale-up (1.05x) or brightness increase on hover.

Smooth transition (0.3s ease-in-out).

Keep it minimal and consistent with overall brand style.

4️⃣ Category Circle Layout — 4 Above + 4 Below (See 3rd Uploaded Image)

Requirements:

Recreate the section shown in the 3rd uploaded image:

Display 8 circular category cards total.

Arrange as:

First 4 circles in the top row

Remaining 4 circles in the bottom row

Use same circular frame design and hover animation from the 2nd image style.

Align perfectly centered with equal spacing and responsive grid behavior.

5️⃣ Fix Image Cropping Inside Circles (See 4th Uploaded Image)

Current Issue:
Category/product images are cut off or not properly centered inside the circular frames.

Fix Required:

Ensure the image fits fully within the circle using proper CSS:

object-fit: cover;
object-position: center;
border-radius: 50%;


On hover, show a zoom-in effect but keep the image completely visible (not cropped).

Maintain circular shape even on hover transition.

🧭 Additional Notes

Keep design fully responsive for all screen sizes.

Maintain the existing Ramani Fashion color palette (mainly pink, beige, and white).

Use smooth transitions and professional typography.

Test both user and admin login flows thoroughly after implementation.

✅ Expected Final Output:

Separate Admin Login/Signup System with OTP verification and secure redirection to Admin Dashboard.

Beautiful horizontal category hover section like the sample image.

Elegant hover animation on Ramani logo.

Perfectly aligned 8-category circular grid (4+4 layout).

Properly fitted and responsive circle images without cropping.
